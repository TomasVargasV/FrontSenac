        The Scream The Scream (Norwegian: Skrik) is the popular name given to
        each of four versions of a composition, created as both paintings and
        pastels, by Norwegian Expressionist artist Edvard Munch between 1893 and
        1910. The German title Munch gave these works is Der Schrei der Natur
        (The Scream of Nature). The works show a figure with an agonized
        expression against a andscape with a tumultuous orange sky. Arthur Lubow
        has described The Scream as "an icon of modern art, a Mona Lisa for our
        time" Edvard Munch created the four versions in various media. The
        National Gallery in Oslo, Norway, holds one of two painted versions
        (1893, shown here). The Munch Museum holds the other painted version
        (1910, see gallery, below) and a pastel version from 1893.
